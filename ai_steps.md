- Add filter job listings based on user-defined criteria (location, role, company) and then push it up. Techniques: Implement a filtering system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization and entity recognition (python).
Criteria Matching: Match user-defined criteria with extracted job details to filter out irrelevant jobs.
- Now make a branch called feature filter_results and make that fix and push the change
- Make a merge against main with these changes
- Add a Notification Mechanism to alert users of new job listings that match their criteria. Techniques: Implement a notification system that sends alerts to users when new job listings are found that match their criteria. Use messaging services such as Twilio (python) or email services such as SendGrid (python) to send notifications.
- Now make a branch called feature and make that fix and push the change
- Make a merge against main with these changes
